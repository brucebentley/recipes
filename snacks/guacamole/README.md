## Ingredients &mdash;

* 2 ripe Haas avocados
* 2 tsp. lime juice
* 2 tbsp. cilantro _(chopped)_
* &frac14; cup onion _(finely chopped)_
* &frac12; jalape√±o, including seeds _(finely chopped)_
* &frac14; tsp. Kosher salt


## How To Make It &mdash;

1. Chose the right avocado. It should feel squishy yet firm _(like the palm of your hand)_, and be  
   a nice dark green color on the outside.
2. Cut the avocado in half and then remove the pit.
3. Scoop the avocados and place in a medium bowl.
4. Toss and coat with lime juice.
5. Add the salt and using a fork or potato masher, mash until a smooth consistency is achieved.
6. Fold in the remaining ingredients and mix well.
7. Taste the guacamole _(over and over)_ and adjust seasoning if necessary.
